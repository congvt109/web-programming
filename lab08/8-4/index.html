    Dear Sirs,
  <P CLASS="body">
    I am writing to inform you that, due to financial difficulties, I will be
    unable to pay my taxes this year.
  <P CLASS="body">
    You see, my company has had reduced profits this year. In fact gross
    revenues have now dropped below the GDP of <B>twelve</B> foreign
    countries! Given this intolerable situation, I am sure you will
    understand.
  <H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
    The 23rd Psalm (King James Version)</H2>
  <SPAN>T</SPAN>he LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
  <P> He made me to lie down in green pastures: he led me beside the still
    waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
    for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
    of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
    staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence
    of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
    Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
    will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
  <P CLASS="foot">
    Sincerely,<BR>
    William A. Bates
